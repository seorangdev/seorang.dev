I always wanted a public medium just for myself where I can use and train my English freely.
That was the main reason why English was choosen as the site's main language.
<br><br>
The original plan was to write the first version in English, then write the Indonesian version.
But writing new article directly in English is harder than writing in my native language.
Not to mention that I need to spend extra time to rewrite the article in Indonesian.
It took so much effort to do both.

Right now, I don't have any English speaking audience.
So no one actually read my article other than myself probably.
But I have many local social media connections that potentially read my articles.
Personally, it makes sense to switch the other way around.
