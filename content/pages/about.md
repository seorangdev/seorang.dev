## What is this?
It's a personal site by [Hizzely](https://github.com/hizzely) that [may or may not be related](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/1323540957128728577) to programming despite the domain name literally means `a dev` in Indonesian. I bought this domain name purely because I liked its uniqueness. 

## Site state

I haven't updated the robots.txt and other search engine related things since the permalinks haven't finalized yet and I don't want search engines to index a broken link.
So if you're not me and you stumbled upon this site, what brought you here? more importantly, how did you find this site?!?! jk, welcome internet strangers!

## Under the hood

This site is built with [Zola](https://getzola.org) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and is now served to you by one of the [Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com)'s servers near you. I designed the layout myself taking inspiration primarily from Material You. The color selection is adopted from a theme made for Obsidian called [Primary](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary) (thanks author!). If you're curious about the code that powers this site, you can take a look at the source which available on [GitHub](https://github.com/seorangdev/seorang.dev).
