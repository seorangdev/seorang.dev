## About Domain Name

Although the domain name `seorang.dev` literally means `a dev` in Indonesian, and yes I'm interested in programming, but that doesn't mean this site is [guaranteed](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/1323540957128728577) to be about career as developer or software development. I didn't even consider that when purchasing this domain.
<br><br>
I simply liked the uniqueness of the domain name since it cannot be mistaken with any other TLDs. This kind of combination is known as
[domain hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack). Unlike common hacks that prioritizes shorter name at the expense of more awkward to type, this name is much more natural to type and easier to remember.

## Site state

As of March 2022, the site design finally taking shape.
But as always, It's still pretty much experimental.
I might make some changes or tweaks here and there or even scrap the design altogether.
<br><br>
In addition, I haven't updated the robots.txt and other search engine related things since the permalinks haven't finalized yet and I don't want search engines to index a broken link.
So if you're not me and you stumbled upon this site, what brought you here? more importantly, how did you find this site?!?! jk, welcome internet strangers!

## Under the hood

This site is built with [Zola](https://getzola.org) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and is now served to you by one of the [Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com)'s servers near you. I designed the layout myself, and it's taking inspiration primariliy from Material You. The color selection is adopted from a theme made for Obsidian called [Primary](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary) (thanks author!). In fact, I decided to adapt the theme exactly because it's comfortable to my eyes when I'm reading and taking note.
